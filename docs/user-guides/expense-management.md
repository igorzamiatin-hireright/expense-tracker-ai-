## FAQ

### Q: Where is my expense data stored?
**A**: Your expenses are stored locally in your browser's storage. This means your data stays private but is only available on the device and browser where you entered it.

### Q: Can I access my expenses from multiple devices?
**A**: Currently, no. Expenses are stored locally per browser. We recommend exporting your data regularly and importing it on other devices when that feature becomes available.

### Q: Is there a limit to how many expenses I can add?
**A**: Browser storage limits vary, but you can typically store thousands of expenses. If you're approaching limits, consider exporting older data and removing it from the active list.

### Q: Can I import expenses from my bank or credit card?
**A**: Currently, manual entry only. Future versions may include import capabilities from CSV files or financial institutions.

### Q: What happens if I accidentally delete an expense?
**A**: Deleted expenses cannot be recovered. Be careful when deleting, and consider exporting your data regularly as a backup.
